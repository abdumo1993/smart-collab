# DocSync AI: Intelligent Documentation Synchronization for GitHub Repositories

## Overview

DocSync AI is a collaborative, AI-powered documentation assistant designed to maintain consistency between source code and its associated documentation. The system monitors changes in GitHub repositories and utilizes LLM agents to detect and flag outdated or inconsistent documentation. With optional user approval, the system can suggest and even apply updates, streamlining the development workflow.

This document outlines the technical architecture, a step-by-step implementation plan, and clearly defined milestones for building DocSync AI using a Python backend (FastAPI preferred for flexibility and async support).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

* Automatically detect changes in code that impact documentation.
* Notify users and provide intelligent update suggestions.
* Enable user-approved AI-assisted documentation edits.
* Integrate with GitHub using a secure, minimal OAuth flow.
* Support collaborative editing using CRDT-based tools.

## ðŸ›  Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and GitHub Integration (Week 1-2)

#### Tasks:

* [ ] Set up FastAPI backend with initial project structure.
* [ ] Create GitHub OAuth flow with restricted access (per-repo).
* [ ] After repo OAuth, automatically create GitHub webhook for `push` events.
* [ ] Store GitHub access tokens securely (encrypted).
* [ ] Verify webhook callback with GitHub secret.

#### Milestone:

* User can input a GitHub repo URL and authenticate.
* Webhook is registered without manual setup.

---

### Phase 2: Code Diff Processing Engine (Week 3)

#### Tasks:

* [ ] On webhook event, clone/pull repo and parse commit diff.
* [ ] Use `unidiff` or similar to extract changed files and functions.
* [ ] Match changed functions with doc references using static analysis.
* [ ] Save mapping of code symbols â†” doc passages (fuzzy matching).

#### Milestone:

* System can detect which code changes may affect which documentation blocks.

---

### Phase 3: Agentic AI Core (Week 4)

#### Tasks:

* [ ] Design agent architecture (Planner + LLM + Tools).
* [ ] Tooling includes: `CodeRetriever`, `DocRetriever`, `DocUpdater`, `Critic`.
* [ ] Use GPT to evaluate semantic difference and generate suggestions.
* [ ] Classify change types: signature change, logic change, rename, deletion, etc.
* [ ] Store suggestions and flag mismatches.

#### Milestone:

* Agent can detect inconsistencies and generate markdown-formatted doc updates.

---

### Phase 4: Collaborative Editor and Notification System (Week 5-6)

#### Tasks:

* [ ] Integrate a CRDT-based collaborative editor (Yjs + WebSocket backend).
* [ ] Display AI-generated suggestions inline (e.g., VS Code style diagnostics).
* [ ] Implement approval workflow (accept/reject/suggest-edit).
* [ ] Allow manual editing within the collaborative environment.
* [ ] Support multiple users editing the doc.

#### Milestone:

* Users can collaboratively review and accept AI suggestions in real-time.

---

### Phase 5: GitHub Writeback and Persistence (Week 6)

#### Tasks:

* [ ] When changes are approved, update the doc file (e.g., README.md).
* [ ] Commit and push to GitHub using stored access token.
* [ ] Handle merge conflicts gracefully.

#### Milestone:

* Docs are automatically updated in the repo upon user approval.

---

### Phase 6: Final Polishing and Deployment (Week 7)

#### Tasks:

* [ ] Add authentication and multi-repo support per user.
* [ ] Polish UI/UX and editor features.
* [ ] Add error handling, logging, and monitoring.
* [ ] Dockerize and deploy to production (Fly.io, Render, etc).

#### Milestone:

* MVP deployed and fully functional.

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

* GitHub OAuth must request only per-repo `repo` scope.
* Webhook secret validation must be enabled.
* All tokens should be encrypted at rest.
* Use short-lived tokens or rotate regularly.

---

## âœ… Future Enhancements

* Natural language question-answering over codebase + docs.
* Slack/Discord bot for doc update approval.
* Integration with ReadTheDocs / MkDocs.
* AI-driven doc generation from scratch for undocumented code.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

DocSync AI leverages agentic AI, GitHub integration, and collaborative editing to solve a common pain point: maintaining reliable, up-to-date software documentation. Its modular and secure design ensures itâ€™s both developer-friendly and scalable.
