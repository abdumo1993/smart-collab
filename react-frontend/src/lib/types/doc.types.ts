/**
 You're looking to implement a "load existing document" flow similar to Google Docs. This involves fetching the document's content, initializing the CRDT with that content, and then syncing with the server.

I'll break this down into a few steps, starting with adding a new function to your `repository.ts` to fetch an existing document.

First, I need to understand the structure of `Doc` and `ApiResponse` to ensure the new method integrates correctly. I'll read the `doc.types.ts` and `types.ts` files to get that information.

You're right, we need to implement the logic for opening an existing document, which involves fetching its state and synchronizing the CRDT. This is a common pattern for collaborative editors like Google Docs.

Based on your description, here's a plan:

1.  **Introduce a new `fetchDocumentContentAndState` function in `react-frontend/src/lib/repositories/repository.ts`.** This function will fetch the initial content of a document and its current CRDT state vector from the backend.
2.  **Define a new type for the response of `fetchDocumentContentAndState` in `react-frontend/src/lib/types/doc.types.ts`.** This will ensure type safety when working with the fetched document data.
3.  **Modify `react-frontend/src/lib/stores/doc-store.ts` to include a new action, `loadDoc`.** This action will:
    *   Call `fetchDocumentContentAndState` to get the document's initial content and state.
    *   Initialize the CRDT with the fetched state.
    *   Handle any subsequent operations received from the backend to bring the client's CRDT up to date.

I'll start by looking at `react-frontend/src/lib/business-logic/CRDT/iterfaces.ts` to see if there's an existing type for `StateVector` that we can use, or if I need to define a new one. This will help us properly type the response from the backend.

Great! The `StateVector` type is already defined as `Map<YjsID["clientID"], number>`, which is perfect.

Now, let's create a new type for the document content and state that will be returned when fetching an existing document. I'll add this to `react-frontend/src/lib/types/doc.types.ts`. This type will include the document's content (the initial string) and the `StateVector`.

Darn, there's a problem, our string literally in (y/n) .t. Now that we have something very unusual on our hands, let's just consider all the problems that could possibly come as if to 1. and then, depending on the current on whether it's an existing tool so might want to have. and finally at the risk of running out of data.
